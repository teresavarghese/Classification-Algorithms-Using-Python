# Classification-Algorithms-Using-Python

This repository contains implementations of various classification algorithms using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Each model is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and Keras.


## Machine Learning (ML) Models

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A decision tree classifier is trained using the entropy criterion to make predictions based on input features.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: An SVC classifier with a linear kernel is used to classify data points into different classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**: A KNN classifier is implemented with Euclidean distance metric to classify data points based on their nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes Gaussian Classifier**: Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the Gaussian probability distribution assumption for features.

## Deep Learning (DL) Models

- **Neural Network Classifier using Keras**: A neural network classifier is built using the Keras library, with multiple hidden layers and ReLU activation functions.
